# :palm_tree: Forest_fire_prediction

**Problem Statement** - To predict a pattern of spread of fire is a very difficult task it includes various factors like wind speed and direction etc. 

**Technologies included** - Machine Learning

**Aim** - We will build an application in which the forest fire will be predicted over the static data .. We will try to make it live if we can using live satellite APIâ€™s
