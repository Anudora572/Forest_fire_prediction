# Project plan: Forest Fire Prediction

## Introduction:

This document lays out a project plan for the development of “Forest Fire Prediction” open source repository system by Priyansh Gupta. The intended readers of this document are current and future developers working on “Forest Fire Prediction” and the sponsors of the project. The plan will include, but is not restricted to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective of the “Forest Fire Prediction” team, scheduling and delivery estimates, project risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which we will develop the project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.

##  Overview:

Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economical and ecological damage while endangering human lives. Fast detection is a key element for controlling such phenomenon.

For example: In Australia, throughout 4 months at least 33 people were killed including four firefighters and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks has burnt. We aim to develop an application in which the forest fire will be predicted over the static data and if possible real time satellite data.
