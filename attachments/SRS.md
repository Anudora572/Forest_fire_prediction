Risk Management

5.1 Risk Identification
Following will be the risk involved in my project:
-> People are already using Facebook to find friends. So, what would be the real cause that would motivate them to join my application.

5.2 Risk Mitigation
-> Even though most of the users would already be using Facebook, our platform would still offer them many things that is not there on Facebook. For eg-
1.They donâ€™t meet people who share common interests and passions as much. Our application would enable them to meet people (apart from usual friends) who share common interests and passions on a more frequent basis.
2. Users of fb cannot share songs on-the-go which they have sung whereas on our app they can do that on-the-go.
3. People can post mysteries/cases and other people can solve it. Moreover, people will get points in case they solve the mysteries or on the basis of popularity of their posts.
4. More importantly, people need not register for my application, but instead, they can login using their already existing accounts of Google/Facebook.

Thus, I think that there is a considerable amount of difference between Facebook/Instagram/Twitter and my application and it would attract many people.
