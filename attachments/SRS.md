## 5. Risk Management:

### 5.1 Risk Identification:

Following are the risk involved in the project:
- To avoid forest fire, we need real time data to predict the place where the forest fire may occur.
- We need to identify the wind speed and direction accurately, so that in case of forest fire, we can stop it as soon as possible.

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation:

- To get the real time analytics we can use Spark (which supports Real time processing) or any other tool that can do real time analysis.
- After getting real time data we can call the Forest department and police station so that they can control the fire and the area around that forest.
- To get high accuracy, we need to monitor the lattitide, longitude and many other factors to get the correct wind direction.
- Large amount of data is needed to get more accurate results to analyze the wind flow properly, which can be done by either big data analysis tools or any other technology/libraries.
