# This is a template of Software Requirement Specification
The purpose of this project is to provide a system that can predict the area of spread of forest fire. We will build an application in which the forest fire will be predicted over the static data. We will try to make it live if we can using live satellite APIâ€™s
GOALS AND SCOPES
1.	This application will be used by government and forest officials.
2.	By prediction we will reduce the frequency and size of fires.
3.	Application may use the satellite images to predict the areas of fire.
4.	Users can input the wind, slope and fuel moisture data.

For future work we can produce wildfire risk maps by considering the vulnerable areas Finding the location of communities with a lower capacity to prevent the wildfires and even the recovery management will be a useful criterion for risk map production.
