## 3. Goals and Scopes:

  * This application will be used by government and forest officials.
  * By prediction we will reduce the frequency and size of fires.
  * Application may use the satellite images to predict the areas of fire.
  * Users can input the wind, slope and fuel moisture data.

For future work we can produce wildfire risk maps by considering the vulnerable areas Finding the location of communities with a lower capacity to prevent the wildfires and even the recovery management will be a useful criterion for risk map production.
