# 2.1 CUSTOMERS
   1. This application can be used by anyone ranging from a child to an old-adult.
   2. The application will use simple language so that everyone could understand it.
   3. This will mainly be made available to forest departments, FRI, NIDM and other such Govt. departments.
# 2.2 FUNCTIONALITY
   1. It can detect and/or predict forest fire at a faster rate.
   2. It can predict the data more accurately by analyzing the data of other recent forest fires.
   3. If given appropriate and accurate data, it can also predict the severity of the fire so proper action can be taken accordingly.
   4. Upon detecting a forest fire, it will immediately send an emergency message to the nearest fire department.
   5. The workflow reads the data trains a regression model based on the spatial, temporal, and weather variables. It can predict the direction of flow of forest fire by analysing the wind speed and hence can also predict the probable area to be affected.
   6. This application will predict forest fire with the help of available statistical data. It is a data mining approach to predict forest fire.
   7. The model is then used to predict the burnt area based on current data and the coordinates where the fire is spotted.
   8. This prediction can be used for calculating the concerned forces to be sent to the incident.
   9. *It can be made live by using satellite APIâ€™s.*
   PS - Points in italic can be inculcated in later updates.
